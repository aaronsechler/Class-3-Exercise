###Question 1 What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?  Robinhood is a financial services company that offers a mobile app and a website that allows people the ability to invest in stocks, ETF, cryptocurrencies and does not charges any fee or requires minimum checking account balance. They made it more accessible to more people to invest easily without paying any fee.  Their biggest competitions are Schwab and E*Trade- who are well established and been in the game for a long time. However, Robinhood seems to appeal more to the Millennials- making very popular in the recent years.

###Question 2 Robinhood uses technology as an advantage in a few ways. First, they are easily accessible to small retail brokers; traditionally, one had to call brokers and pay hefty fees. Robinhood also provides up-to-date market quotes through a simplified user interface which attracts new investors. 
Robinhood is a FinTech company because they provide synergies within both Finance and Tech. For Finance, Robinhood provides commission free investing and democratizes investing to small and new retail clients. For Tech, Robinhood provides up to date market costs, a simplified brokerage platform, and new product offerings (crypto, options, etc).

###Question 4
The listed above assets are stocks, EFT’s and crypto currencies and it will play an important role for the companies, because everyone mostly invest in EFT’s and stocks. The purpose of installing the Robinhood app that you can buy the stocks and crypto currencies from there and also now every bank gives the access to robin hood, so every can easily buy it from their bank and the money will be deducted from the bank account immediately.
The crypto currencies are becoming popular every where right now, recently I read to an article it was saying that the bills will be no more. It was specifying to crypto currencies, because no one likes to carry wallet and everything is becoming digital day by day, so why not wallets. If the crypto currencies will be in the market all you have to carry is one coin or a phone may be, but it would be very easy to access all the things digitally.
